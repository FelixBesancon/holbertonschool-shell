# Project 1: Shell, permissions

## Description
This project introduces Unix permissions and user/group management. You will practice changing file modes, owners and groups, working with symbolic links, viewing identity and groups, and using `sudo`/`su` appropriately. All scripts are minimal, executable, and follow strict formatting rules.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What file permissions are on Linux and how to read them
- How to represent owner/group/other permissions as a single digit
- How to change permissions (`chmod`), owner (`chown`) and group (`chgrp`)
- Why a normal user cannot `chown` files and how to use `sudo`/`su`
- How to run a command with root privileges
- How to print real/effective user and group IDs (`id`, `whoami`, `groups`)
- How to create users and groups

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Environment: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **All scripts must be exactly two lines long** (`wc -l file` ‚Üí `2`)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of every file must be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` at the root of this project describing what each script does
- **Do not** use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`
- All scripts must be executable (`chmod u+x <file>`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tasks **3 / 13 / 14 / 15 / 16** must be run inside the sandbox for checker validation
