# Project 0: Shell, basics

## Description
This project introduces the Unix shell and core filesystem/navigation commands. You will practice reading man pages, using built-ins and external commands, handling options/arguments, listing files (including hidden ones), creating/moving/deleting files and directories, and working with links and wildcards. All scripts are minimal, executable, and follow strict formatting rules.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What the shell is, what a terminal is, and what the shell prompt represents
- What a shebang is and why we use `#!/bin/bash`
- The basics of command history and how to read man pages
- Navigation: `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `.` and `..`, home vs. root directories, hidden files
- Looking around: `ls`, `less`, `file`, long listing format
- Links: hard vs. symbolic (`ln`)
- File operations: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`
- Command discovery: `type`, `which`, `help`, `man`, and when to use each
- Wildcards (globbing) and how to apply them
- What LTS means

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Environment: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **All scripts must be exactly two lines long** (`wc -l file` â†’ `2`)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of every file must be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` at the root of the repository describing the repository
- A `README.md` at the root of this project describing what each script does
- **Do not** use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`
- All scripts must be executable (`chmod u+x <file>`)
